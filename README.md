# **lynxy**
Local (Yielding?) Network (eXchange?) (the extra y is cosmetic~)
***
# **Introduction**
Lynxy is a LAN server-client system coded in Python. It allows for easy setup of a server, as well as easy setup for clients on the same network as the server.
The use of this module is so that if people were to make programs that require a LAN system, they can use what is provided here as terms for communication for a game, a texting platform, and more! <br>
*This project is also named after my ~ windy ~ friend :3* <br>
The first section will explain instructions that apply to both, and then we will cover each individual part.
***
# **General setup**
Before we do anything, you should first install this module with pip.
-     pip install lynxy
-     python3 -m pip install lynxy
When you do this, it will install both the modules "lynxy" and "lynxy_server". Once this is done, you are ready to read the instructions on the following sections about setting up your client, server, or both.
