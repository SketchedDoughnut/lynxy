# v0.0.3 - v0.0.6
**5/28/24 - 6/4/24**
- Releases for the old system of Lynxy, before the full rewrite of Lynxy (>=1.0.0). This version is drastically different then the full rewrite, and considerably worse.
- Commit label: None

# v1.0.0
**1/6/25**
- The first official release of the completely refactored and re-written Lynxy client. The lynxy_server implementation has been dropped for now, and plans for that as a seperate package are coming in the future. As of when this release was made, no documentation was written but was being worked on. 
- This release defines how Lynxy will work from now on, and sets the starting point for growth in the future.
