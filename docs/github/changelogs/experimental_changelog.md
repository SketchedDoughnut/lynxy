# v0.1.19

- Added the distribution feature to the server properly, with some minor handling. It is still an experimental feature and can't be fully relied on. However, encryption works fine!

***

# V0.2.0 - v0.2.14
**1/4/25**
- These releases were the first ones in a while, as the entirety of Lynxy has been refactored and rewritten to be simpler, more lightweight, and quicker. The lynxy_server addition has been dropped, but a server implementation might be made in the future. More information will be shared in the official release when the documentation is out (This is being written before documentation is complete).
