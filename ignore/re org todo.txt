DO THESE IN ORDER PLEASE
- clean up pyproject.toml for lynxy and lynxy_server
- clean up lynxy and lynxy_server
- improve documentation
- release lynxy_server as a standalone extension for lynxy
    - release on test pypi first
- release lynxy as its own module, seperate of lynxy_server
- clean up files a bit more



IMPORTANT: KEEP THESE IN MIND WHEN REFACTORING lynxy_server
- request_username_data() should only work if the server is configured for having clients directly communicate. Otherwise, if the server is configured to have the clients communicate through the server, deny them with a response code
- add processor to properly string together inputs (mainly for listener clients sending data, but see where else this is needed)

IMPORTANT: KEEP THESE IN MIND WHEN REFACTORING lynxy
- add something to split packets up into smaller bits before sending off
